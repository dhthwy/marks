Some like doing maths, maybe they're even good at it, but most don't make money from it. And of the ones that do, only some make bank doing it. Coding is much the same. It takes a special set of circumstances to earn from it. Ultimately, other people decide your worth. Markets are one of the few places where your worth isn't decided by others.
